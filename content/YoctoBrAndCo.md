Here are [the slides](../documents/YoctoBuildrootAndCo.pdf) about the talk I
gave during the [11th Fribourg Linux Seminar](
http://fribourg-linux-seminar.ch/seminaires_linux/). I wanted to explain the
different philosophies behing the two major build systems available in the
comunauty.

Maybe my opinion was a bit flawed as I haven't used buildroot for few years and
I know Yocto better. At then end, both projects are good, make sure you thought
about everything you will need during the whole lifetime of your product! The 
time was too short, I spoke only about two but don't forget considering other
alternatives!
