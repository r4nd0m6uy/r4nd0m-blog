I'm [R4nd0m 6uy](http://r4nd0m6uy.ch) and live in
[Fribourg](http://www.fribourgtourisme.ch), Switzerland.

# Job
My current job is developping embedded Linux softwares for the next generation
of X-Ray generators at [Comet](http://www.comet-xray.com/).

I mostly write C/C++ source code, a bit of shell scripts and do some basic web
programming but that is not really my cup of tea ...

Alongside I take care of the
[BSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_support_package) and tweak a bit the
[Linux kernel](http://www.kernel.org)

# Hobbies
Of course, my job is one of the hobby that takes most of my time but I also do
other things.

## Skateboard
When the weather permits, I go out and go down the hill with my skateboards. I
have few at home but my favorite is a [Penny](http://www.pennyskateboards.com/)
alike that is made from wood.

## Video games
I like playing video games with a strong emphasis on retro gaming.

## Music
I wish I could call myself a musician but I mostly play for fun and to relax. I
learned keyboard when I was young and play with the old keyboards I got from my
father [who is a real pianist](http://bulls-band.ch/).

I'm very glad to have some treasures like his old
[Fender Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_piano) and his
[Yamaha DX-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DX7). Unfortunately they
don't work as if they were brand new but I'm planning to fix that issue soon or
later!

## Beers
When well deserved, I enjoy drinking nicely chosen beer, my favorites are
the Belgium one, especially abbaye and dark beers.
[I sometime brew beer myself](https://github.com/r4nd0m6uy/GuixBeers) but that's
hard work and haven't had time to do it again since a while...

# Spoken languages
My mother tongue is **French** but I can understand and speak a bit of
**English** and a bit less of **German**.

That's why you might see some mistakes or sentences that look gramatically
weird. In that case, do not hesitate to contact me, so I can learn and fix them!
